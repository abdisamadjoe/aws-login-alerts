This project shows you how to build a simple alert system that sends you an email **whenever someone logs into your AWS account**.

Whether it's a root account or an IAM user, this setup will notify you in realtime. It's a perfect project if you're learning **cloud security** and want something **practical and beginner-friendly**. You only need 3 AWS services, and everything is free tier eligible.

## üóÇÔ∏è What You‚Äôll Be Using

Here are the 3 AWS services powering this alert system:

- **CloudTrail** - records login events  
- **EventBridge** - detects those events in realtime  
- **SNS (Simple Notification Service)** - sends an email notification  

Everything is native to AWS, and works perfectly together.

1. A user logs into the AWS Console  
2. CloudTrail captures the login event  
3. EventBridge detects it and triggers a rule  
4. SNS sends an email alert to your inbox

## ‚úÖ Let‚Äôs Build It ‚Äì Step by Step

2. Go to **Trails**, click **Create Trail**  
3. Name it something clear like `login--trail`  
4. Choose **Create new S3 bucket**  
5. You can turn off encryption (SSE-KMS) if not needed

### 4. Create an EventBridge Rule

This is the logic that watches for login events and triggers the email.
